# dotfiles

Dope default dotfiles for a HyperModern development environment built for mac, bash-it + nix + direnv.

This directory is meant to be cloned as is into your HOME directory and installed via symlinking (by running the installer).

Rather than installing it directly, it's convenient to just install [CLEO](https://github.com/hyper-modern/cleo-ai)!

## Installation

Option A. Just install [CLEO](https://github.com/hyper-modern/cleo-ai)!

Option B. Run the following commands:
```
cd ~
git clone git@github.com:hyper-modern/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
./install.sh
```
